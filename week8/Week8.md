## Project3_Virtual Dream Space

## Intro
It all starts with tapping a glass ball, namely the “Dream Ball”. When you touch the Dream Ball, things would start leaking out of it, revealing an ephemeral wonderland full of strange fauna and flora. Each subsequent touch would add new creatures and unique melody to the dream land. After your dream is fully loaded, you’ll blow air onto the Dream Ball to trigger waves + fogs, corresponding to your breathing pattern.

Environment: At first it is black, by touching the glass ball, increase the material like waves and fogs<br>
Objects: glass balls<br>
Interactive possibilities: Mouse simulates hand, touching glass ball<br>

I was influenced by works of Brett Whiteley. The aesthetic goal is to portray a poetic, hazy dream world where dimensions dissolve and objects intertwine.
