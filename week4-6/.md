# Project2_Archeologies of the Futures

## Backgournd
In this future world, due to the worsening environment and the extinction of plants, people face increasing pressure and anxiety. In order to alleviate this situation, a new type of device - plant mood regulator - has been invented. This device helps people relax and relieve stress and anxiety by simulating the shape and scent of plants.

These regulators come in various shapes and sizes, some look like small potted plants, while others look more like indoor decorations. Their shells are usually made of glass or resin, very transparent and beautiful. Inside the regulator, various sensors, gas generators, and electronic controllers are installed, which can detect the user's emotional changes and release corresponding gases to relieve the user's stress according to data analysis.

These gases usually include aromatherapy scents, oxygen, negative ions, temperature regulation, etc. By changing the type and amount of gases released, the regulator can meet the different needs and preferences of users. For example, if the user feels tired and stressed, the regulator can release some gases that help to relax and sleep; if the user needs to increase alertness and energy, the regulator can release some gases that stimulate the nerves.

With the popularity of plant mood regulators, people's lives become more comfortable and enjoyable. People can use these regulators at home, office, or public places to enjoy their benefits anytime and anywhere.

#### Describe
It's a bright, sunny day in the year 2050, and you're standing on a bustling street corner in a major city. The air is crisp and clean, thanks to advances in renewable energy and green technology. Electric and self-driving cars whiz by on the streets, but there are also plenty of pedestrians and cyclists, as the city has prioritized sustainable transportation options.
As you look around, you notice that the buildings are all covered in greenery, with rooftop gardens and vertical farms providing fresh produce for the local community. In the distance, you can see a towering skyscraper made entirely of recycled materials, a symbol of the city's commitment to sustainability.

#### Background
In the year 2055, as environmental degradation and climate change continue to pose significant threats to the natural world, the loss of plant life becomes more widespread. In response, artificial plants made from materials such as glass, plastic, or resin become increasingly popular and prevalent in both urban landscapes and everyday life. These plants provide an alternative to their living counterparts, which may be harder to maintain or simply no longer available.

These artificial plants come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and colors, and are designed to mimic the appearance of real plants as closely as possible. With the help of advanced technology, they may be able to move and sway in the breeze, or even emit artificial scents to further enhance their realism. They may also incorporate smart features such as sensors or programmable lighting to adjust their appearance and behavior in response to changing environmental
