## Discription
- This is an underwater world, the gravity in this world is unstable, we can change their position by dragging and dropping objects

## Process
- Scene

- At the beginning, multiple objects were placed in the room and their state was set to hovering in the air

- Users can drag and drop objects to move with the mouse

## Reflection
Through this homework. I learn how to use CustomPass. One of the main benefits of it is that it provides me with complete control over the rendering process. This can be particularly useful for creating custom post-processing effects or implementing advanced rendering techniques, such as ray tracing or volumetric lighting.
